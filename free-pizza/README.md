# FREE PIZZA & BEER!!  
## (and other mistakes we make in building an inclusive community)

### Abstract
Let's talk about what it means to build an inclusive community, where folks from diverse backgrounds can come together. 

I don't need to provide dozens of studies and academic works to tell you there is a problem. In this session, we'll move past that. We'll talk about real experiences of feeling excluded, of feeling a sense of otherness. Rather than getting hung up on defining terms like "equity" and "intersectionality" through their (boring) dictionary definitions, we'll try to define them through a series of stories. 

For this session, bring both your own personal experience, and an openness to accept the lived experiences of others. We will talk about how you can approach conversations, experiences, and communities in a more inclusive way, so that we can all do our part in building a more welcoming place to be.
