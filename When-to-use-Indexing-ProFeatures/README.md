# When to use indexing pro features

### Abstract
Using the right index for the right scenario can be the "go fast" button that keeps queries and customers happy. 

Over the years, Microsoft has given us many different indexing options and flavors. Today there are many more considerations beyond "clustered or non clustered". We'll cover all those different flavor options: Filtered, Compressed, Columnstore, included columns, and Partitioning. 

We'll cover an overview of what each of these options are, and then dive into some code examples to see how and when each of these work, and when the don't. 

You will leave the session with a much better idea of how and when to use each of these special indexing flavors to meet your needs.
